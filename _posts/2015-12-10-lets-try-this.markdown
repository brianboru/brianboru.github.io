Hello.
====== 

Welcome - thanks for dropping by!

Over the next while I plan to write about my experience building Erlang and Elixir systems in the FinTech space.

Some background - I'm a developer with close on twenty years experience building system in the payments, 
financial services and e-commerce areas. Up to now my primary toolset was based around the Microsoft .NET 
platform. More recently I have started looking at functional approaches/languages and have settled on devoting 
time to building systems up on the Erlang VM (BEAM). Right now we are looking at both Erlang and Elixir. What both? We 
have two primary usage scenarios, and from what I learned to date, it seems that Erlang is a good fit for one 
with Elixir looking like a good fit for the another. I'll write an article with a little more detail around this shortly.

In the meantime, sit back, relax and watch out for my first real article which will look at records in Erlang.

BTW: all of this is hosted in my [github repo](http://github.com/brianboru/brianboru.github.io) so if you see something wrong and have a better way of doing to, I'll 
happily accept any pull requests! :-)
